## 🎓 Coursework Projects
During my studies, I've tackled a variety of projects that have allowed me to apply classroom theories in real-world scenarios. Below are some key projects that showcase my skills and learning:

### **Data Mining**
- **Project Title**: Association Rules-based Movie Recommender
  - **Description**: Developed a recommendation system that uses association rules to suggest movies based on user preferences and avoid potential dislikes, enhancing viewer satisfaction.
  - **Tools**: Python, Pandas, mlxtend
  - [Explore the project](https://github.com/lukik45/movieRecommender)

### Information Retrieval
- **Project Title**: Dynamic Article Recommendation Engine
  - **Description**: Engineered a recommendation system using machine learning to suggest articles to users of the "Rick and Morty" fandom wiki. Implemented features include text similarity-based dynamic suggestions, efficient data processing, and user-engaging visualizations.
  - **Tools**: Python, BeautifulSoup, spaCy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
  - [Explore the project](https://github.com/lukik45/article-recommendation)

### Deep Learning
- **Project Titile**: Sequence Defect Prediction and Localization
  - **Description**: Utilized LSTM networks to predict and localize defects in sequence data, demonstrating handling of variable sequence lengths and batch processing.
  - **Tools**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
  - [Explore the project](https://github.com/lukik45/candle-defect-detection)

- **Project Title**: Enhancing CNNs for Robust Image Classification
  - **Description**: Developed multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to classify images from the '101 Object Categories' dataset. Implemented techniques like dropout, regularization, and data augmentation to enhance model accuracy and robustness against overfitting.
  - **Tools**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy
  - [Explore the project](https://github.com/lukik45/image-classifier)


### Decision Analysis
During the Decision Analysis course, I learned to construct and apply various Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tools for decision aid. We have presented some of these tools in the form of Google Colab notebooks [avalilable here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fJT8LLj_zr8Qrl8upaAHDEIHp0OL8PtY?usp=sharing).

What I learned:
- data collection
- custom plotting with matplotlib
- efficient calculations with numpy
- MCDA tools for decision aid

### Software Engineering
During Software Engineering course, I gained knowledge and experience concerning various concepts retalted to the desing and maintainance of software.
- agile development: I was a scrum master for our course project ([Link to our course project](https://github.com/lukik45/PUT-SE-BuildingInfo))
- git 
- functional/non-functional requirements
- CI/CD 
- UML notation
- Design Patterns, Architectural Patterns 
- Testing: unit testing, automated testing using Selenium, performance testing
- REST API




### Object Oriented Programming
During this course, I gained the knowledge and experience with:
- programming in Java
- writing clean, object oriented code
- creating GUI using JavaFX
